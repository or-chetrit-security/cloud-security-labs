# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the lab implementations or documentation, please report it responsibly.

### üö® For Critical Security Issues
- **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
- Contact me directly via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/orisraelche
- Include detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for response and remediation

### üìù For General Security Improvements
- Open a GitHub issue with the label `security-enhancement`
- Suggest improvements to security practices
- Propose additional security controls

## Security Considerations in Labs

### What We Include
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security configurations
- ‚úÖ Principle of least privilege implementations
- ‚úÖ Compliance framework mappings
- ‚úÖ Cost optimization with security considerations

### What We Avoid
- ‚ùå Real credentials or sensitive data
- ‚ùå Overly permissive configurations
- ‚ùå Security anti-patterns
- ‚ùå Configurations that could create vulnerabilities

## Responsible Disclosure

If you find security issues in the lab implementations:

1. **Assess Impact** - Determine if it's a learning issue or actual vulnerability
2. **Report Privately** - Use direct contact for serious issues
3. **Provide Details** - Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
4. **Allow Response Time** - Give reasonable time for remediation

## Security Best Practices

When implementing these labs:
- Always use dedicated lab/development environments
- Never use production credentials
- Follow cleanup procedures to avoid unnecessary costs
- Review and understand all configurations before implementation
