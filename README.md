## 🎯 About This Repository

As a cloud security engineer, I'm documenting practical implementations of security controls across major cloud platforms. Each lab addresses real security challenges with hands-on, tested solutions.

**Perfect for:**
- Security engineers building cloud expertise
- Teams implementing specific security controls
- Professionals preparing for cloud security certifications
- Organizations seeking practical security implementations

## 🚀 Lab Collection
